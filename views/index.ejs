<h3>What is a software development company?</h3>
<p>Software development companies design, develop and maintain applications, frameworks or other software components for businesses or consumers.To get a deeper understanding of what this process involves, let’s start by talking about what software development is. Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. A software development company puts all of these pieces together. This includes everything from the software’s conception to the final manifestation of the software—research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, and more.Each company will have its own engagement model and process for working with clients. However, before starting a project with a software development company, it’s important to understand exactly what they do. </p>
<h3>What does a software development company do?</h3>
<p>Among the many services they do, at the core, we can break down this process into four steps.</p><ol>
    <li><h4>Identifying the need</h4><p>First, a software development company will strive to understand the importance of the software they’re going to create. What makes it important? What features need to be included? How will this software impact users?</p></li>
    <li><h4>Developing the software</h4><p>Next, the company will go ahead and design and develop the software to meet the criteria they identified and the users’ needs. The products they work on may include desktop solutions, mobile applications, SaaS products, and more.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Testing & quality assurance</h4><p>If a software company follows the agile methodology, they may make testing and iterations part of the development process. Some companies don’t follow this methodology, and they do their testing at the end.
    <br>In either case, once the software company completes development, they will test it to ensure that it functions the way it should and that users will get the desired results. They will also use this time to identify any feedback and resolve any bugs they may discover throughout the process.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Release and maintenance</h4><p>Finally, the company will release the product. At this stage, the product is ready for users, and organizations can use their custom software. A software development company may also include on-going maintenance or support to ensure the product is always working the way it should.
    <br>Most software development companies will follow this basic process. However, some companies implement what they learn after working on various projects to refine their process and make it seamless for each customer.</p></li>
</ol><p>Bottom line: software development companies create solutions that need the needs of their customers. They often specialize in different industries or businesses and have insight into what their customers require to be successful.</p>
